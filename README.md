## Analysis Summary::

This Analysis looks at school distric, and student performance meta data, trying to find relationships to come to conclusions about how a schools performance is dictated by size, budget, and type. 
When combing thorough summary metrics of this data, it is clear that, unintuitivly, that per student capita seems to have almost an inverse relationship to test scores, and overall passing %. Another obvious 
conclusion is that large schools sizes (2000+) have significantly less passing % rates than those of schools of size (<2000). Finally, it appeared that charter schools seemed to have nearly double the % overall passing rating, suggesting the influence of other factors that impact academic succsess students are faced with when attending a public, or 'distric' school.
